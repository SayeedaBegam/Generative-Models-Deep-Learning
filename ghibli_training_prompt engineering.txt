Using a single prompt like
`"a busy market, in <sks> style"` will train the LoRA to associate **“market”** with your style token. You’ll get a model that’s great at markets—but less general elsewhere. To make `<sks>` a **general Ghibli‑style trigger**, vary the text conditioning during training.

## What to change

1. **Diversify prompts per image (subject/scene/lighting/composition).**
   Keep `<sks>` constant, vary everything else so the model learns “this token = style,” not “this token + market.”

2. **Keep a “class word” near the token.**
   E.g., `"<sks> style illustration"`, `"<sks> style anime artwork"`, `"<sks> cel‑shaded background"`. This helps steer the embedding toward style features.

3. **Use prompt dropout (\~10%).**
   Occasionally train with an empty prompt so the UNet gets a tiny unconditional signal; this makes CFG work better at inference.

4. **If you’re training the text encoder LoRA too:** don’t overfit it—use modest rank (r=8), dropout 0.1, and varied prompts.

## Drop‑in prompt randomizer (replace your fixed prompt)

Here’s a simple generator you can plug into your dataset/collate to produce a **different prompt each batch** while always including `<sks>`:

```python
import random

INSTANCE_TOKEN = "<sks>"

subjects = [
    "a busy market", "a forest path", "a seaside village", "a steam-powered workshop",
    "a grassy hill with wildflowers", "a small kitchen", "a flying machine over clouds",
    "a quiet library", "a mountain valley", "a river with stepping stones"
]

styles = [
    f"in {INSTANCE_TOKEN} style", f"{INSTANCE_TOKEN} style illustration",
    f"{INSTANCE_TOKEN} inspired artwork", f"{INSTANCE_TOKEN} cel-shaded art",
    f"{INSTANCE_TOKEN} watercolor look"
]

lighting = [
    "at golden hour", "on an overcast day", "at dusk with warm lanterns",
    "in soft morning light", "under moonlight"
]

compositions = [
    "wide shot", "medium shot", "low angle", "overhead view", "cinematic framing",
    "rule of thirds composition"
]

extras = [
    "soft color palette", "hand-painted textures", "gentle linework",
    "simple shapes", "whimsical mood", "calm atmosphere"
]

def make_prompt(dropout_prob=0.10):
    # 10% unconditional (prompt dropout)
    if random.random() < dropout_prob:
        return ""
    s  = random.choice(subjects)
    st = random.choice(styles)
    li = random.choice(lighting)
    co = random.choice(compositions)
    ex = ", ".join(random.sample(extras, k=2))
    return f"{s}, {st}, {li}, {co}, {ex}"
```

### Wire it into your dataloader

Replace your fixed `prompt` usage with this:

```python
class ImageOnlyDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, image_dir: str, resolution: int = 512):
        # ... your existing code ...
        self.prompt_fn = make_prompt  # inject generator

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        # ... your existing image code ...
        return {'pixel_values': px, 'prompt': self.prompt_fn()}

def collate(batch):
    pixel_values = torch.stack([b['pixel_values'] for b in batch])
    prompts = [b['prompt'] for b in batch]
    return {'pixel_values': pixel_values, 'prompts': prompts}
```

That’s it—now every sample (or at least every batch) carries a different, generic scene description with the **same** style trigger `<sks>`.

## Small training tips specific to “style token” LoRAs

* **Text encoder LoRA:** keep `lora_dropout=0.1`, `r=8`, `alpha=16`. If you also initialized a new token embedding row, you can optionally let **only that row** learn (plus the LoRA) to keep the rest of CLIP stable.
* **UNet LoRA:** target attention projections only (`to_q/k/v`, `to_out.0`) for stability.
* **Batch captions:** If you have image‑level captions (BLIP, etc.), you can combine them with the template:
  `f"{caption}, in {INSTANCE_TOKEN} style, soft color palette, gentle linework"`
  This increases subject diversity further.
* **CFG during eval:** keep it modest (≈5–6) to preserve Ghibli’s soft palette.
* **Schedulers:** Euler (smooth/painterly) or DPM‑Solver++ 2M (fast, clean at low steps) are good starting points.

## Quick A/B test idea

* Train one epoch with your **old fixed prompt** and save adapters → `old/`.
* Train one epoch with the **randomized prompts** above → `new/`.
* Load each adapter set in turn and generate with the same seeds:

  * “a castle on a cliff, in `<sks>` style”
  * “a cat on a train seat, in `<sks>` style”
  * “a forest spirit at night, in `<sks>` style”
* You should see the **new** one generalize much better beyond “market”.

If you want, I can tweak the prompt pools to focus more on **background paintings** vs **character shots**, depending on what your dataset emphasizes.
